This idea is for the healthcare industry or we can say it as a business model.

Basic idea:-

Patient comes to hospital >here z-health card is generated(qr code card or simple tap card) which contains details related to patient > once card is done a user is created and stored in server > once user is done we should have two apps Zdevice app and brand user device app.

Zdevice app is used to get the user history on scanning of the z-health card like prescription,demographic details ,survey taken and many more.

Brand user app is used by the patient to take the survey and submit those surveys which will give details of patients related to particular disease surveys.


Once the patient visits the doctor , the doctor will perform as usual check up on the patient and update all the details to the web application.

Web application is where the doctor will enter all the details related to the patient and also can create the survey for particular days so that based on the survey he can identify the major and minor diseases and many more things and the same data is stored in a server with a z-health card secret code or user number.

Once a survey is created by a doctor then this survey will be pushed to particular patients  Brand user app where user takes the survey and submits it.

So when a patient comes to visit that hospital or doctor he scans or taps the card to zebra devices which will open all history related to the patient ,survey given and other details on the secondary screen.


Future ideas:

This model can be made global.

Things used by healthcare client if implemented
1 zebra devices.
2 zebra software.
